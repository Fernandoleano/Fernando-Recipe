			<h1>About Us</h1>
			<p>Hi there! My name is Fernando Leano, and I'm a full-stack developer with a passion for coding and a strong creative streak. I've been working in the tech industry for several years, and during that time I've honed my skills as a developer and learned to love the process of building new things from scratch.</p>
			<h3>My experience</h3>
            <p>My experience as a developer has allowed me to work on a wide variety of projects, from small-scale applications to complex enterprise-level systems. I have a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies, and I love to stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the field. I take pride in my ability to find elegant solutions to complex problems, and I'm always looking for new challenges to tackle. In addition to my technical skills, I'm also a highly creative person. I love to explore new ideas and come up with innovative ways to solve problems. I'm a big believer in the power of design thinking, and I enjoy collaborating with others to create solutions that are both functional and visually appealing. If you're looking for a skilled developer who can bring a fresh perspective to your projects, look no further! I'm always eager to take on new challenges and help my clients achieve their goals.</p>
